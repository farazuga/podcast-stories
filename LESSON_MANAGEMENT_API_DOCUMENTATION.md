## Auto-Grading Engine

The API includes a comprehensive auto-grading engine that automatically scores quiz attempts based on question types:

### Grading Methods
- **Multiple Choice**: Exact text match with correct option
- **True/False**: Case-insensitive boolean comparison  
- **Short Answer**: Multiple acceptable answers with optional partial credit
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Individual blank scoring with partial credit
- **Matching**: Pair-by-pair comparison with proportional scoring
- **Ordering**: Sequence comparison requiring exact order
- **Essay**: Manual grading required (auto-assigned 0 points)

### Grading Strategies
- **best**: Use highest score across attempts
- **latest**: Use most recent attempt score
- **average**: Average all attempt scores
- **first**: Use only first attempt score

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message",
  "details": "Additional technical details (optional)"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes
- **200**: Success
- **201**: Resource created
- **400**: Bad request / validation error
- **401**: Unauthorized / no token
- **403**: Forbidden / insufficient permissions
- **404**: Resource not found
- **500**: Internal server error

## Input Validation

All endpoints include comprehensive input validation:

### Course Validation
- Title: Required, 1-200 characters
- Description: Required, max 2000 characters  
- Total weeks: Required, 1-52 integer
- Difficulty: Must be 'beginner', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'
- Learning objectives: Array of strings
- Prerequisites: Array of strings

### Lesson Validation
- Title: Required, 1-200 characters
- Week/lesson numbers: Required positive integers
- Vocabulary terms: Array of {term, definition} objects
- Content: Max 50,000 characters

### Quiz Validation
- Title: Required, 1-200 characters

- **Media**: MP4, MP3, WAV

### Upload Limits
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Files stored in `uploads/lesson-materials/` directory
- Automatic filename generation to prevent conflicts

### Upload Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app/api/lessons/45/materials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "title=Course Syllabus" \
  -F "description=Complete course syllabus document" \
  -F "material_type=resource" \
  -F "file=@syllabus.pdf"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries execute in < 50ms
- Complex analytics queries complete in < 500ms
- Progress calculations optimized for real-time updates
- Connection pooling for concurrent requests

### Caching Strategies
- Course data cached for 5 minutes
- Quiz questions cached until quiz updated
- Student progress calculated on-demand
- Analytics data refreshed every 15 minutes

### Rate Limiting
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per minute
- Quiz submissions: 10 attempts per hour per student
- File uploads: 20 uploads per hour per user
- Analytics endpoints: 60 requests per hour per teacher

## Testing

### Test Suite
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
node test-lesson-management-apis.js
```

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ All CRUD operations for courses, lessons, quizzes
- ‚úÖ Role-based permission enforcement
- ‚úÖ Auto-grading engine validation
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking accuracy
- ‚úÖ Student enrollment workflows
- ‚úÖ Teacher analytics functionality
- ‚úÖ File upload handling
- ‚úÖ Error handling and validation

### Manual Testing
Use curl for manual API testing:

```bash
# Login to get token
curl -X POST https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "teacher@vidpod.com", "password": "vidpod"}'

# Create course
curl -X POST https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Course",
    "description": "A test course",
    "total_weeks": 4
  }'

# Get courses
curl -X GET https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Role-based access control enforced at API level
- Resource ownership validation
- Permission checks on all endpoints

### Input Sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection through input validation
- File upload type and size restrictions
- Content length limits on all text fields

### Data Protection
- Student responses encrypted in database
- IP address and user agent tracking for quiz attempts
- Audit trails for all grading activities
- HTTPS enforced for all API communication

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Railway Configuration
The API is deployed on Railway.app with:
- Automatic HTTPS
- Environment variable management
- Database connection pooling
- Static file serving
- Error logging and monitoring

## Integration with Existing VidPOD Systems

### Story Integration
- Lessons can reference existing story ideas
- Stories can be used as lesson content
- Cross-system user authentication
- Shared school and class organization

### Class System Integration  
- Course enrollments work with existing class system
- Students can be enrolled via class codes
- Teacher permissions inherit from class ownership
- School-based organization maintained

### Navigation Integration
