# VidPOD Deployment Summary
**Date:** January 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All Fixes Deployed to Production

## Overview
This document summarizes all bug fixes that have been implemented and deployed to the VidPOD production environment at https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app

## Deployed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Network Error on Login (FIXED)
**Issue:** Users encountered "Network Error" when trying to login
**Root Cause:** Missing `config.js` script in authentication pages, causing `window.API_URL` to be undefined
**Fix Applied:** Added `<script src="js/config.js"></script>` to all authentication pages
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/frontend/index.html`
- `/backend/frontend/forgot-password.html`
- `/backend/frontend/reset-password.html`
- `/backend/frontend/register-teacher.html`
- `/backend/frontend/register-student.html`
**Status:** Deployed and verified working

### 2. ✅ CSV Upload Not Working (FIXED)
**Issue:** CSV file upload failed with "No file uploaded" error
**Root Cause:** Frontend sending FormData with field name 'csvFile' but backend expecting 'csv'
**Fix Applied:** Changed FormData field name from 'csvFile' to 'csv' in stories.js
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/frontend/js/stories.js` (line ~380)
**Status:** Deployed and verified working

### 3. ✅ Favorites Error (FIXED)
**Issue:** Clicking favorites button resulted in JavaScript errors
**Root Cause:** Multiple issues including poor DOM selectors, missing validation, insufficient error handling
**Fix Applied:** Complete rewrite of toggleFavorite function with:
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Multiple DOM selector strategies
- Input validation and null reference protection
- Proper loading states and user feedback
- Comprehensive error messages
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/frontend/js/stories.js` (toggleFavorite function, lines 700-850)
**Status:** Deployed and verified working

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Statistics (FIXED)
**Issue:** Dashboard showing "0" and "Loading..." for all statistics
**Root Cause:** Missing dashboard statistics functions in dashboard.js
**Fix Applied:** Added all required statistics loading functions
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/frontend/js/dashboard.js`
**Functions Added:**
- `loadDashboardStats()`
- `loadMyStoriesCount()`
- `loadMyFavoritesCount()`
- `loadTotalStoriesCount()`
- `loadMyClassesCount()`
- `loadRecentActivity()`
**Status:** Deployed and verified working

### 5. ✅ User Info Display (FIXED)
**Issue:** Dashboard showing "undefined" for username
**Root Cause:** Phase 1 authentication changes - users have email but not username
**Fix Applied:** Updated user info display logic to handle Phase 1 authentication
**Code Change:**
```javascript
const displayName = user.name || user.email || user.username || 'User';
```
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/frontend/js/dashboard.js`
**Status:** Deployed and verified working
