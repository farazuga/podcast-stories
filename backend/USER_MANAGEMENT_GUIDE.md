## üîê User Accounts

### Default Test Accounts
```
Super Administrator:
Email: superadmin@vidpod.com
Password: rumi&amaml
Role: super_admin

Regular Administrator:
Email: admin@vidpod.com  
Password: rumi&amaml
Role: amitrace_admin

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### Users Table Updates
```sql
-- Role constraint updated to include super_admin
CHECK (role IN ('amitrace_admin', 'super_admin', 'teacher', 'student'))

-- CASCADE relationships for hard delete
FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### Deletion Impact Function
```sql
-- Function to calculate deletion impact
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_deletion_impact(user_id_param INTEGER)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    result JSON;
    class_count INTEGER;
    student_count INTEGER;
    story_count INTEGER;
    favorite_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Count classes that will be deleted
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO class_count FROM classes WHERE teacher_id = user_id_param;
    
    -- Count students that will be removed from classes
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT uc.user_id) INTO student_count
    FROM classes c JOIN user_classes uc ON c.id = uc.class_id
    WHERE c.teacher_id = user_id_param;
    
    -- Count stories that will be deleted
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO story_count FROM story_ideas WHERE uploaded_by = user_id_param;
    
    -- Count favorites that will be deleted
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO favorite_count FROM user_favorites WHERE user_id = user_id_param;
    
    result := json_build_object(
        'classes_to_delete', class_count,
        'students_to_unenroll', student_count,
        'stories_to_delete', story_count,
        'favorites_to_delete', favorite_count
    );
    
    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
