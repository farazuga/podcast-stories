# VidPOD Rundown Creator - Session Resume Instructions

## How to Resume This Specific Session

### IMPORTANT: This session is for VidPOD Rundown Creator Integration work
### Don't confuse with other Claude Code sessions you may have running

## Method 1: Resume by Directory (RECOMMENDED)
1. Navigate to this project directory first:
   cd /Users/faraz/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Amitrace/Vibe/1_Test/podcast-stories/rundown-creator

2. Then resume the session:
   claude --resume

   This will resume the session associated with THIS directory specifically.

## Method 2: Resume by Session ID
1. List all sessions:
   claude --sessions

2. Find the session with working directory:
   /Users/faraz/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Amitrace/Vibe/1_Test/podcast-stories/rundown-creator

3. Resume with that specific session ID:
   claude --resume <session-id>

## Method 3: Start Fresh with Context
If you want a new conversation but with all the project context:
1. cd /Users/faraz/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Amitrace/Vibe/1_Test/podcast-stories/rundown-creator
2. claude
   (Claude will automatically read CLAUDE.md for context)

## Quick Commands (Save These!)
