## üîó Architecture Integration

### Database Integration
All features are designed around the **multi-tier relational schema**:

- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Ensure data integrity across all feature interactions
- **Junction Tables**: Handle many-to-many relationships (stories‚Üîtags, users‚Üîclasses, users‚Üîfavorites)
- **Approval Workflows**: Database-enforced approval states with proper indexing
- **Limited Soft Deletion**: Only `classes` table has `is_active` flag for maintaining active/inactive class status

### API Integration  
Features map directly to **RESTful API endpoints**:

- **Authentication**: JWT middleware ensures role-based feature access
- **Authorization**: Route-level permissions align with feature capabilities
- **Consistent Patterns**: All features follow same request/response patterns
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across all feature endpoints

### Frontend Integration
UI components integrate with the **unified navigation system**:

- **Role-Based Rendering**: Features automatically show/hide based on user permissions
- **Responsive Design**: All features work across desktop and mobile devices  
- **Consistent Styling**: Features share common CSS design system and components
- **Accessibility**: Features implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support
