# VidPOD Railway Deployment Guide

*Comprehensive guide for deploying the VidPOD application to Railway.app*

---

## 📋 Overview

This guide documents the complete deployment process for VidPOD on Railway.app, including common issues, solutions, and configuration best practices learned from production deployment experience.

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**  
**Production URL:** https://podcast-stories-production.up.railway.app

### Architecture Context

VidPOD's deployment leverages its **three-tier architecture** for optimal Railway.app hosting:

- **Frontend Layer**: Static files served by Express.js from `backend/frontend/`
- **Backend Layer**: Node.js/Express.js API with JWT authentication and 18 modular routes
- **Database Layer**: Railway PostgreSQL addon with complex relational schema

**For complete architectural understanding, see: [System Architecture Overview](../architecture/system-overview.md)**

### Database Deployment Context

Production deployment handles VidPOD's **multi-tier relational schema**:

- **Complex Relationships**: Foreign key constraints and junction tables deployed intact
- **Role-Based Data**: User roles (amitrace_admin, teacher, student) with proper access control
- **Approval Workflows**: Story approval and teacher request tables with status tracking
- **Data Integrity**: Referential integrity maintained across all table relationships

**For database schema visualization, see: [Database Schema Diagram](../architecture/system-overview.md#database-schema-relationships)**

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Railway account and CLI installed
- GitHub repository connected to Railway
- PostgreSQL service provisioned in Railway

### Deployment Command
```bash
railway up --detach
```

That's it! The application should deploy successfully using the optimized configuration.

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### nixpacks.toml (Primary Build Configuration)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs', 'npm']

[phases.install]
cmds = ['npm ci']

[phases.build]
cmds = ['npm run build 2>/dev/null || echo "No build script, skipping"']

[start]
cmd = 'npm start'
```

### railway.json (Deployment Settings)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS", 
    "buildCommand": "npm install"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Dockerfile (Backup Configuration)
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy backend package files first
COPY backend/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production  

# Copy backend source code

## 🔧 Railway Service Configuration

### Critical Settings

#### Backend Service Configuration
- **Name:** `backend` or `podcast-stories-backend`
- **Root Directory:** `backend` ⚠️ **CRITICAL - MUST BE SET TO `backend`**
- **Build Command:** Auto-detected from nixpacks.toml
- **Start Command:** `npm start`
- **Builder:** Nixpacks (recommended)

#### Environment Variables (Required)
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...     # Auto-provided by Railway PostgreSQL service
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key        # Set manually (generate secure key)
NODE_ENV=production               # Set manually
PORT=                             # Auto-assigned by Railway (don't set manually)
```

#### Optional Environment Variables
```env
# Email configuration (if using email features)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=app-password

# Default admin credentials
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@vidpod.com
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)
**Best for:** Direct deployment, bypassing GitHub issues

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Deploy directly
railway up --detach

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --tail
```

### Method 2: GitHub Integration
**Best for:** Automated deployment on push

1. Connect GitHub repository to Railway project
2. Set Root Directory to `backend` in service settings
3. Push changes to trigger auto-deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Railway"
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Manual Deployment via Dashboard
**Best for:** One-time setup or troubleshooting

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Configure service settings
4. Trigger manual deployment

## 🏗️ API Deployment Architecture

### Route Module Deployment

VidPOD's **18 modular route files** are deployed as a unified Express.js application:

```javascript
// Deployed route structure in production
app.use('/api', require('./routes/auth'));         // Authentication endpoints
app.use('/api', require('./routes/stories'));      // Story management
app.use('/api', require('./routes/users'));        // User management
app.use('/api', require('./routes/classes'));      // Class management
app.use('/api', require('./routes/favorites'));    // Favorites system
// ... all 18 route modules loaded
```

**For complete API structure, see: [API Routes Diagram](../architecture/system-overview.md#api-routes-structure)**

### Authentication Deployment

Production JWT authentication configuration:

```env
# Production environment variables for authentication
JWT_SECRET=secure-production-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production

# Default admin account (created on first deployment)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-production-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@vidpod.com
```

### Frontend Deployment Integration

The **unified navigation system** deploys seamlessly:

- Single `includes/navigation.html` template served from `backend/frontend/`
- Role-based JavaScript controllers loaded on all authenticated pages
- Mobile-responsive CSS served from static file middleware
- All frontend assets served through Express.js static file handling

**For navigation architecture details, see: [Navigation System Documentation](../architecture/navigation.md)**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: 502 Bad Gateway Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Application starts but returns 502 errors
- Railway logs show successful build but no responses

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect Root Directory setting
- Server not binding to correct PORT

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify Root Directory is set to "backend"
# 2. Ensure server.js uses process.env.PORT
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Issue 2: "Failed to snapshot repository"

**Symptoms:**
- Railway can't read GitHub repository
- GitHub integration fails to trigger deployments

**Root Cause:**
- GitHub repository structure issues
- Railway permissions problems

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use Railway CLI to bypass GitHub issues
railway up --detach
```

### Issue 3: Database Connection Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Application starts but database operations fail
- "Connection refused" errors in logs

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect DATABASE_URL
- PostgreSQL service not linked

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify PostgreSQL service is running
railway status

# 2. Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
railway variables

# 3. Ensure services are properly linked
```

### Issue 4: Build Configuration Conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- "Could not determine how to build the app"
- Build fails with dependency errors

**Root Cause:**
- Multiple conflicting configuration files
- Wrong directory references

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Use Nixpacks as primary builder
# 2. Ensure nixpacks.toml is properly configured
# 3. Remove conflicting Docker/build configs if needed
```

### Issue 5: Database Table Reference Errors

**Symptoms:**
- API returns 500 errors
- Database queries fail

**Root Cause:**
- Code references wrong table names
- Database schema inconsistencies

**Fixed Issues:**
```sql
-- Fixed in routes/favorites.js
JOIN story_ideas s  -- was: JOIN stories s

-- Fixed in routes/analytics.js  
FROM story_ideas s  -- was: FROM stories s

-- Fixed foreign key references in migrations
```
