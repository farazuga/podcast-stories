# VidPOD Lesson Management System - Database Schema Documentation

**Phase 1A Complete: Database Schema Architecture**  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**System:** VidPOD Educational Podcast Application  
**Branch:** lessons  

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the VidPOD Lesson Management System database schema, designed to support teacher-created courses, interactive lessons, quizzes, worksheets, and comprehensive student progress tracking.

## Database Schema Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Maintains VidPOD's existing three-tier user system (amitrace_admin, teacher, student)
2. **Progressive Learning**: Supports lesson prerequisites and unlocking mechanisms
3. **Flexible Content**: Uses JSONB for adaptable content storage
4. **Performance Optimized**: Comprehensive indexing strategy for common query patterns
5. **Data Integrity**: Robust constraints and cascade relationships
6. **Analytics Ready**: Built-in progress tracking and performance metrics

## Database Functions

### 1. calculate_lesson_completion(student_id, lesson_id)
**Purpose**: Calculate completion percentage for a specific lesson

**Logic**:
- Counts required materials (quizzes and worksheets)
- Calculates completion based on passed quizzes and submitted worksheets
- Returns percentage (0-100)

**Usage Example**:
```sql
SELECT calculate_lesson_completion(123, 456) as completion_percentage;
-- Returns: 75.00 (if 3 of 4 required materials completed)
```

### 2. calculate_course_progress(student_id, course_id)
**Purpose**: Calculate overall course progress with detailed metrics

**Returns JSONB**:
```json
{
  "total_lessons": 9,
  "completed_lessons": 4,
  "current_lesson_id": 567,
  "overall_progress": 44.44
}
```

### 3. update_student_progress(student_id, lesson_id)
**Purpose**: Automatically update student progress based on completions

**Features**:
- Calculates current completion percentage
- Updates progress status automatically
- Sets completion timestamp when lesson finished
- Maintains progress history

### 4. check_lesson_prerequisites(student_id, lesson_id)
**Purpose**: Verify if student can access a lesson based on prerequisites

**Returns**: Boolean (true if prerequisites met, false otherwise)

**Logic**:
- Checks `requires_completion_of` array
- Verifies all prerequisite lessons have status 'completed' or 'passed'
- Returns true if no prerequisites exist

## Performance Optimization

### Index Strategy

**Primary Indexes** (automatically created):
- All primary keys (`id` columns)
- All unique constraints

**Query-Optimized Indexes**:
```sql
-- Course queries
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_teacher_id ON courses(teacher_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_school_id ON courses(school_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_active ON courses(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Lesson queries  
CREATE INDEX idx_lessons_course_id ON lessons(course_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_lessons_week_number ON lessons(course_id, week_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_lessons_published ON lessons(is_published) WHERE is_published = true;

-- Progress tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_student_progress_student_id ON student_progress(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_progress_course_id ON student_progress(course_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_progress_completed ON student_progress(completed_at) WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Quiz performance
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_attempts_quiz_student ON quiz_attempts(quiz_id, student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_attempts_status ON quiz_attempts(status);
```

**Specialized Indexes**:
- GIN indexes for JSONB content searching
- Partial indexes for active/published content
- Composite indexes for common query patterns

### Query Performance Guidelines

**Fast Queries** (< 10ms):
- Single lesson by ID
- Course lessons ordered by week
- Student progress for specific lesson
- Quiz attempts by student

**Medium Queries** (10-100ms):
- Course progress calculations
- Student completion statistics
- Material completion rates

**Slow Queries** (100ms+):
- Cross-course analytics
- School-wide progress reports
- Complex prerequisite chains

## Data Integrity & Constraints

### Foreign Key Relationships

**Cascade Deletions**:
- Course deletion removes all lessons, materials, and progress
- Lesson deletion removes all materials and progress
- User deletion removes all associated data

**Null References**:
- School deletion sets course.school_id to NULL
- Teacher deletion in grading preserves records but nullifies grader reference

### Check Constraints

**Validation Rules**:
```sql
-- Positive values only
total_weeks > 0
week_number > 0
lesson_number > 0
attempt_number > 0

-- Percentage ranges
completion_percentage >= 0 AND completion_percentage <= 100
percentage_score >= 0 AND percentage_score <= 100
passing_score >= 0 AND passing_score <= 100

-- Valid enum values
difficulty_level IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')
status IN ('not_started', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'passed', 'failed', 'skipped')
```

### Unique Constraints

**Critical Uniqueness**:
- Lesson ordering: `(course_id, week_number, lesson_number)`
- Quiz attempts: `(quiz_id, student_id, attempt_number)`
- Student progress: `(student_id, lesson_id)`
- Course enrollments: `(student_id, course_id)`

## Sample Data Structure

### Course Example
```sql
INSERT INTO courses (title, description, teacher_id, total_weeks, learning_objectives)
VALUES (
  'Introduction to Podcasting',
  'A comprehensive 9-week course covering podcast production fundamentals',
  123,
  9,
  '["Understand audio production basics", "Develop storytelling skills", "Master interview techniques"]'::jsonb
);
```

### Lesson Example
```sql
INSERT INTO lessons (course_id, title, week_number, lesson_number, vocabulary_terms)
VALUES (
  456,
  'What is Podcasting?',
  1, 1,
  '[
    {"term": "Podcast", "definition": "Digital audio program for download/streaming"},
    {"term": "RSS Feed", "definition": "Standardized web feed for episode distribution"}
  ]'::jsonb
);
```

### Quiz Question Example
```sql
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (quiz_id, question_text, question_type, answer_options)
VALUES (
  789,
  'What does RSS stand for?',
  'multiple_choice',
  '[
    {"text": "Really Simple Syndication", "is_correct": true},
    {"text": "Radio Station Streaming", "is_correct": false},
    {"text": "Recorded Sound System", "is_correct": false}
  ]'::jsonb
);
```

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access

**Teachers Can**:
- Create/edit their own courses and lessons
- View enrolled student progress
- Grade student submissions
- Manage course materials

**Students Can**:
- View enrolled courses and available lessons
- Submit quiz attempts and worksheets
- View their own progress and grades
- Access unlocked course content

**Admins Can**:
- Access all courses and data
- Generate system-wide reports
- Manage user enrollments
- Override unlock requirements

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling**:
- Student responses stored securely in JSONB
- IP addresses and user agents for integrity checking
- Encrypted password hashes for quiz passwords
- Audit trails for all grading activities

## Migration and Deployment

### Files Created

1. **`015_create_lesson_management_system.sql`** - Complete migration file
2. **`validate_lesson_management_system.sql`** - Schema validation script
3. **`test-lesson-management-system.js`** - Comprehensive test suite
4. **This documentation file**

### Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Run the migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/migrations/015_create_lesson_management_system.sql

# 2. Validate the schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/migrations/validate_lesson_management_system.sql

# 3. Run comprehensive tests
node test-lesson-management-system.js

# 4. Verify sample data
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT title FROM courses WHERE title LIKE '%Podcast%';"
```

### Rollback Strategy

If rollback is needed, execute in reverse dependency order:
```sql
DROP TABLE course_enrollments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE student_progress CASCADE;
DROP TABLE worksheet_submissions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE worksheets CASCADE;
DROP TABLE quiz_attempts CASCADE;
DROP TABLE quiz_questions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE quizzes CASCADE;
DROP TABLE lesson_materials CASCADE;
DROP TABLE lessons CASCADE;
DROP TABLE courses CASCADE;

DROP FUNCTION calculate_lesson_completion(INTEGER, INTEGER);
DROP FUNCTION calculate_course_progress(INTEGER, INTEGER);
DROP FUNCTION update_student_progress(INTEGER, INTEGER);
DROP FUNCTION check_lesson_prerequisites(INTEGER, INTEGER);
```
