## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **Initial Test Issues (Fixed)**
1. **Test Script API Endpoints:** ❌→✅ Updated test to use correct endpoint patterns
2. **Role Data Parsing:** ❌→✅ Fixed to read `response.data.user.role` instead of `response.data.role`  
3. **Frontend File Names:** ❌→✅ Corrected test to look for `rundowns.js` not `rundown.js`

### **System Status: No Critical Issues Found**
All initially detected "issues" were **test script errors**, not actual system problems. The production rundown system is fully functional.
